## Introduction to Problem
In Singaporeâ€™s recycling plants, such as SembWaste, there is heavy reliance on manual labour for identification and sorting of recyclable materials which present challenges in meeting the increased demand efficiently (Kashyap, 2022). The current system is not only labour
intensive, but also poses numerous health threats to the workers, which makes it tough for companies to find workers to perform the tasks.

## Proposed Solution
The introduction of an image recognition system can allow for the automation of identification of recyclable materials among the piles of trash, and also sorts it based on the different recyclable material on a conveyor belt. As accuracy is essential in this step, it is ideal for the trash to be sorted automatically one by one. This would tackle the bottleneck in the current recycling system by improving the efficiency of sorting the trash into the recyclable ones and reducing manpower.
